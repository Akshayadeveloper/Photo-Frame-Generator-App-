# Photo-Frame-Generator-App-
This GitHub repo hosts a user-friendly web tool for framing photos. Users upload an image, select a frame color, and create a framed version, downloadable as PNG. HTML/CSS form the interface, while JavaScript drives interactions and dynamic frame generation on a canvas.
